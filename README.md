# success-patterner
This project is about digging under the surface for indicators of what success means to me (or anyone) personally...
I started it while trying to figure out 'where I fit' professionally and holistically in the work world. 

These are the different pieces:
- Mind Map (xmind file)
- Python Webscraping (data sources)
- Database (tbd)
- Analysis (tbd)
- Summary (here?)
